## General Descriptors:
For Senior Fellowship (D3) you need to show a 
### ‘sustained record’ of leading or influencing (D3.1)
focus on identifying appropriate examples of your recent practice, typically from the last 3-5 years. If you need to refer back to practice from more than 5 years ago, you need to ensure that you focus on how this now influences your current practice.

### practice is effective, inclusive and integrates all Dimensions (D3.2)
this is where a lot of the touch points of As, Vs, and Ks will need to be checked off.

### practice extends significantly beyond direct teaching
For D3.3 your evidence will need to show that your practice extends significantly beyond direct teaching and/or direct support for learning (as illustrated in Figure 4).
