## Context Statement (300 words)
I am currently a full time teaching-focused lecturer (Level B) in the School of Computing, Faculty of Science and Engineering, at Macquarie University (a mid-top tier university in Sydney, Australia). 

I started out 15 years ago as a casual staff member who (within the space of 3 years) was offered to take on some lecturing and convening roles within units at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. I was later offered a full time fixed term contract which was renewed twice, and was then converted to a full time continuing position as a lecturer.  

During my time at Macquarie I have been working with many academic staff and professional staff at the School, Faculty, and University levels on various initiatives. In this submission I'll be focusing on two themes 

Since 2019, during my usual teaching duties, I have been teaching about 1000 to 2000 students each semester (split across 3 to 5 units at undergraduate and or postgraduate level). 

After running a variety of units over many semesters, and having to coordinate across many different teaching teams, there were opportunities for me to talk with other casual and full time academic staff about the teaching needs of our staff and also about some of the curriculum holes in some of our programs. 

This led me down two parallel paths of which I have combined into two themes for this submission:

- My first theme is on my leadership, continued contribution to, and strong advocacy for onboarding, induction, and professional development for academics - but especially casual staff.
  

- My second theme is on my involvement and leadership in curriculum design and  development, degree accreditation review and consultation and feedback on proposed university policies that impacted students. This was heavilly influenced by my collaboration with course directors, and my term of service on the university Academic Senate and one of the senate subcomittees on academic curriculum, quality, and standards.

During the past 5 years at Macquarie University I have been able to contribute to a few areas in a role as a representative on the univertisty academic senate, and one of its sub-comittees on curriculum review and academic quality and policies. I have been interim course director for the bachelor of Information Technology during a time when it was undergoing an internal curriculum lifecycle review.

I have also developed induction materials and run inductions sessions for our sessional (casual) academic staff in the School of Computing. That had been running successfully for a number of semesters befor the faculty asked us to run a series that woudl be open to all Faculty Sessional Academcis that wanted to do more professional development.

- Note: influencing the faculty staff, working with academics and professionals.


have developed onboarding materials for new Academics in the School of computing where we ran a 3 day academic onboarding workshop for all recently new Academcis in the School of Computing.
