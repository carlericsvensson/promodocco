## Context Statement (300 words)
```
Provides a brief summary of your higher education roles, responsibilities and professional experience.

+ provide a brief summary of your teaching and/or support of learning experience, including the context in which you currently work, your current role and responsibilities in teaching and/or support of learning. Identify the type and location of institution(s) you work for, as this will help to set out the context for your work, but keep this brief and relevant to your role. Do not include details about the history and prestige of the institution(s), as your Account of Professional Practice is about you and your practice.

+ identify the students/colleagues that you work with; for example, student level of study (e.g. year of study, undergraduate, postgraduate, etc.), programme(s)/unit(s) of study, discipline/specialist area of work, number and types of learners, etc. For Senior Fellowship, your work with students may be more indirect, as you may work more closely with colleagues/teams/external organisations/professional bodies, etc.; in which case identify these aspects of your work.

+ outline your current and recent role(s)/experience related to influence and leading the practices of others; for example, support, supervision, management, mentoring, etc.

+ focus on your current and recent practice, which should be able to demonstrate your sustained impact at Descriptor 3, typically over the last 3-5 years;

+ remember that your application for Senior Fellowship is based on your higher education practice.

I am currently a full time teaching-focused lecturer (Level B) in the School of Computing, Faculty of Science and Engineering, at Macquarie University (a mid-top tier university in Sydney, Australia). 

I started out 15 years ago as a casual staff member who (within the space of 3 years) was encouraged take on some lecturing and convening roles within units at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. I was later offered a full time fixed term contract which was renewed twice, and was then converted to a full time continuing position as a lecturer.  

During my time at Macquarie I have been working with many academic staff and professional staff at the School, Faculty, and University levels on various initiatives. In this submission I'll be focusing on two themes 

Since 2019, during my usual teaching duties, I have been teaching about 1000 to 2000 students each semester (split across 3 to 5 units at undergraduate and or postgraduate level). 

After running a variety of units over many semesters, and having to coordinate across many different teaching teams, there were opportunities for me to talk with other casual and full time academic staff about the teaching needs of our staff and also about some of the curriculum holes in some of our programs. 

This led me down two parallel paths of which I have combined into two themes for this submission:

- My first theme is on my leadership, continued contribution to, and strong advocacy for onboarding, induction, and professional development for academics - but especially casual staff.
  

- My second theme is on my involvement and leadership in curriculum design and  development, degree accreditation review and consultation and feedback on proposed university policies that impacted students. This was heavilly influenced by my collaboration with course directors, and my term of service on the university Academic Senate and one of the senate subcomittees on academic curriculum, quality, and standards.

During the past 5 years at Macquarie University I have been able to contribute to a few areas in a role as a representative on the univertisty academic senate, and one of its sub-comittees on curriculum review and academic quality and policies. I have been interim course director for the bachelor of Information Technology during a time when it was undergoing an internal curriculum lifecycle review.

I have also developed induction materials and run inductions sessions for our sessional (casual) academic staff in the School of Computing. That had been running successfully for a number of semesters befor the faculty asked us to run a series that woudl be open to all Faculty Sessional Academcis that wanted to do more professional development.

- Note: influencing the faculty staff, working with academics and professionals.


have developed onboarding materials for new Academics in the School of computing where we ran a 3 day academic onboarding workshop for all recently new Academcis in the School of Computing.


## Reflective and Narritive Case Studies (6000 word + 500 words for references)
```
Reflective Narrative and two Case Studies should between them provide evidence that your professional practice meets the requirements of PSF 2023 Descriptor 3

The overall word limit for the Reflective Narrative and two Case Studies is 6,000 words;
please note that the Advance HE online system will not exceed this limit.
You are also allocated up to 500 words for your Reference List (see Section 4.5 below).
You can choose how to spread the balance of the 6,000-word limit across your Reflective Narrative and Case Studies; we recommend that you should aim to use around 2,000 words in the Reflective Narrative and around 2,000 words in each Case Study.

For Senior Fellowship (D3) you need to show a ‘sustained record’ of leading or influencing (D3.1); focus on identifying appropriate examples of your recent practice, typically from the last 3-5 years. If you need to refer back to practice from more than 5 years ago, you need to ensure that you focus on how this now influences your current practice.

You will also need to show that your practice is effective, inclusive and integrates all Dimensions (D3.2).

For D3.3 your evidence will need to show that your practice extends significantly beyond direct teaching and/or direct support for learning (as illustrated in Figure 4).

Section 5 of this guidance document provides you with more information about how to address the three Descriptor 3 criteria statements and Section 6 provides guidance about how to plan and structure your Reflective Narrative and Case Studies.

Within your Reflective Narrative and Case Studies provide selective examples of your practice and ensure they have direct relevance to your claim for Senior Fellowship and make a strong case against Descriptor 3. The quality of the examples of evidence is much more important than the quantity.

===================================================
Developing the reflective practice

Developing your Reflective Narrative and Case Studies requires you to identify/gather and consider evidence of your practice, reflecting on the impact you have made on high quality student learning via your work in leading and/or influencing the learning and teaching practices of others. You should include appropriate rationale for the approaches you took and evidence the effectiveness of your practice; use examples from your practice to make clear what you did, why/how you did it that way and how you know that this was effective.
You should avoid long descriptions of what you ‘did’ and take a reflective stance so that it is clear what you did, how/why you did it that way, how you know this was effective and what you will do in future as a result.

Writing about the ‘why you did it that way’ will enable you to provide evidence for V3: use scholarship, or research, or professional learning, or other evidence-informed approaches as a basis for effective practice.
A simple reflective model for you to use throughout your Reflective Narrative could be to clearly explain:
+ what you did (be selective with the examples you choose to include)
+ why you did it in this way; clearly explain your approach and justify your choices and decisions (e.g. use of an appropriate evidence-informed approach to suit your context, etc.)
+ how you carried out this approach (e.g. including any specific challenges or practical issues you had to overcome)
+ how you evaluated the effectiveness of what you did (explain the kinds of ‘information’ you used to review and evaluate your work, including the impact this had on student learning via your influence on colleagues’ practices)
+ what changes you made as a result of evaluating your effectiveness; for example, developing your evidence-base (V3) or engaging in professional development (A5), etc. and applying learning from this to enhance your practice (use examples to illustrate).

I started as a casual academic many years ago and had to find out what needed to be done by asking people. I felt that this institutional knowledge was in abundance with quite a number of people. It was great to have a community of academics that could help knowlegably on any number of academic or personal matters.

After being a sessional academic for a number of years, I started to become more invovled in the day to day operations of university business - including providing feedback on new building designs for teaching spaces, providing feedback on policies in Academic Senate, and being part of a core professional accrediation team preparing the doccumentation to submit for our degrees to get external professional accrediation.




I recently attended a workshop arranged by our Faculty to attend a workshop series held by Dr Lauren Woodlands (QUT) who curated a phenominal experience and helped a number of us to realise the impact of our teaching and interactions with peers. Through one of the exercises, one of my peers created a card that summarised their understanding of what my "mantra" is in the education space. 

Carl: "Effecting meaningful change by creating the waves for others to surf. Respect!"

It was nice to see this contextualised and curated in this way.
